            <p>RJames Baseball is a browser based multiplayer baseball game. It allows groups of people to form a baseball league and draft players from throughout baseball's history to play games against one another. Players can choose rosters, set their lineups, and then follow their team's progress from game to game by looking at box scores, reviewing individual game play-by-plays, or parsing through the many stat charts available throughout the site.</p>
                
            <p>RJames Baseball uses a C++ program to simulate the individual games. That program is connected to a MySQL database via the MySQL API, which has been integrated into the program and is supported by custom classes to optimize its use within the context of the game. The website is built with PHP on the backend and a combination of HTML/CSS and Javascript on the frontend. It uses Bootstrap 4 for most of its styling.</p>
